      <h1>The First 12 Commandments of Cosmism</h1>
      <p> Death diminishes man and debases the human character: fear for one’s life gives rise to cowardice, baseness, falsity, and ugliness. Death is also responsible for the deepening root of social injustice, monstrous private ownership, and the antagonism between individuals, nationalities, and classes. The restriction in time --that is, death-- represents the age-old foundation for the spiritual and material decomposition of both the individual and society.
But, man has within him an instinct for immortality, at once powerful and unquenchable, and can never therefore, be reconciled with the order of death. Death is sologically senseless, ethically inadmissible, and aesthetically ugle that the question of immortality inevitably emerges in a person’s consciousness. In his inability to face death, man has looked for salvation in religion and mysticism in the hope of immortality, if only for the soul.
At a time when religion has finally become obsolete, when a religious and mystical solution to the question of immortality can no longer be offered as real bread, and death’s stronghold has been shaken biologically, mankind has, at last, come close to solving the realization of the individual immortality as the immortality of the individual in the fullness of its physical and spiritual powers.
In Biocosmism, every individual-and indeed mankind as a whole- will find complete freedom only in the struggle for individual immortality. Biocosmism maintains that this struggle represents the true basis for spiritual and material union of the people, that the individual and society will grow to unprecedented heights in terms of strength and creativity, and that, through its involvement in this struggle, human character will enjoy unparalleled advances.
Note that Biocosmism also regards the question of personal immortality, or immortalism, as a question of resurrection. Resurrection is, above all, a logical conclusion to personal immortality and a guarantee against the chance death-avoidable in principle- of a person already assured of personal immortality. The question of resurrection is also a question of renewal of life of those who have lived before.
Biocosmism raises the question of interplanetary ism at the same time as immortalism. If death (a restriction in time) is the primary root of evil in the life of the individual and society, then its secondary root is caused by a restriction in space, which is to say, the primary position accorded by one’s home, hometown, native land or state, and race. At the end of the day, even internationalism relates merely to a certain locality within the universe.
Mankind has already approached the question of interplanetarianism, since an era of space travel will immediately follow an era of air travel. Interplanetarianism involves the problem of how to master cosmic space, how to become a citizen of the cosmos and an active participant in  life in space, regulating and transforming the cosmic bodies at will through wisdom, and reshaping the old and creating new worlds.
The questions of immortalism and interplanetarianism must not be viewed independently or linked mechanically. They are both intimately interconnected, constituting a single organic whole united under a single term. Biocosmism.
Even if there is an element of fantasy to Biocosmism, this fantasy of ours should not be relegated entirely to the realms of utopia. Since it depends on the latest advances in science and technology, the fantasy of Biocosmism has matured sufficiently for the questions of immortalism and interplanetarianism to become the ”order of the day.“ We contend that Biocosmism is the new supreme life-plan for the single individual as well as humankind as a whole, and that it is now time to set about realizing this plan.
We believe that the time has now come for us to present the questions associated with Biocosmism as life's urgent objectives. OUr belief is based on our opinion that a worldwide struggle between the oppressed and their oppressors and between labor and capital is now unfolding before us. This struggle seeks to destroy class divisions; in our view, this is a prerequisite to the organizing of the universal questions associated with Biocosmism. The Revolution will undoubtedly embrace Biocosmism, so that defining, collecting, and organizing the tendencies embodied within it will become the most important task of the revolutionaries. With the Revolution under way, an outline of the questions pertinent to Biocosmism, the highest possible plan, is essential in order to bring victory to those in revolt. This understanding of Revolution allows us not to postpone the realization of the ideas of Biocosmism to the postrevolutionary future, but rather to begin with the implementation of the ideas of Biocosmism right now.
In the struggle for Biocosmism, it would be unthinkable either to imitate or concur with religious or mystical tendencies. INstead of immortality beyond the grave and immortality in spirit, our goal is to promote here on Earth, in the real cosmocs, the immortality of the individual- with all its spiritual and physical powers. Our relationship with religion and mysticism is, therefore, irredeemably negative. IN the same way, instead of a dreamy, poetic, imaginative penetration of the universe, we favor a realistic interpretation of space travel as the immediate task of technology.
In the struggle for Biocosmism, we are reliant on the latest scientific and technological achievements, striving to transform them at the same time as philosophy, sociology, economics, art, and so on, in keeping with our teleology; that is to say, their form and content must be developed to accord with the great objectives of Biocosmism. This is why Biocosmism represents the beginning of a completely new culture, a new order of things, and a new objective reality. </p>
