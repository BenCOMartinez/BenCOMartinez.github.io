      <p style="color:yellow;"><font face = "Verdana" size = "5">My name is Ben Martinez and I am an Astrophsyics student who studies AGN under <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/academics/faculty/emoran/profile.html">Ed Moran</a> and EGMF under <a href="http://web.phys.ntnu.no/~mika/">Michael Kachelriess</a>.</font></p>
      <h2 style="color:#00FFFF;"><font face = "Verdana" size = "5">AGN</h2>
      <p style="color:#00FFFF;"><font face = "Verdana" size = "5"> Cosmological simulations have shown that the fraction of low-mass galaxies in today’s universe that contain a nuclear black hole is directly related to the mechanism by which massive black hole seeds formed in the early universe. Here, we create an unbiased sample of nearby galaxies, dominated by low-mass "dwarf" galaxies in order to develop an objective picture of black hole-powered activity in today’s universe. From a variety of sources of optical spectroscopic data, including the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Kitt Peak National Observatory (KPNO), we have determined the redshift (i.e., distance) and physical classification of 310 galaxies within a 256 deg2 region of sky. Using these data, we have separated the objects into four distinct activity classes: quiescent (inactive) galaxies, star- forming galaxies, LINER galaxies, and black hole-powered active galactic nuclei (AGN). This allows us to make a preliminary assessment of the black-hole content in nearby low-mass galaxies, which can ultimately provide insight into the origins of supermassive black holes. </font> </p>

      <p style="color:#00FF00;"> <font face = "Verdana" size = "5">Magnetic fields have been detected in galactic clusters, superclusters, and voids of the Large Scale Struc- ture (LSS). It is generally accepted that these astronomical magnetic fields are produced via the amplifica- tion of pre-existing magnetic fields, or “seed” fields. Weak, large scale magnetic fields dissipate energy on timescales comparable to the age of the universe, and therefore may conserve the strength gained from the initial amplification process. Amplification processes are driven by dynamos and flux-conserving compres- sion during structural collapse. Although these processes can amplify extant magnetic fields, they cannot produce them on their own, so the seed fields had to be generated via an altogether different mechanism. This mechanism must either pre-date the epoch of structural formation or have occurred at its onset. </p>
